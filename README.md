This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework, Advisory Board Reinforcement Learning (AdvB-RL), designed to enhance cooperative decision-making by incorporating multiple advisory boards into the learning process. 
Unlike conventional approaches that depend on a single agent or policy, AdvB-RL leverages the collective wisdom of multiple neural networks, each trained on distinct episodes and contributing collaboratively to optimize the agentâ€™s decision-making.
By setting new benchmarks in terms of adaptability, scalability, and performance across complex environments, AdvB-RL establishes itself as a leading solution for reinforcement learning tasks, providing a powerful and efficient framework for advanced decision-making and control systems.
